Project Idea: Hotel Reservation System

A newly established Hotel in Paris sent a request to our team for a reservation system application. Our team commited to implement the first version of this application to the Hotel by May 14, 2016. During this time, our staff will be engaged with the hotel stakeholders to discuss their needs and feature set. The version one of the application will be used for evaluation purposes. Then, the Hotel stakeholders can provide us their feedback for the next versions.
